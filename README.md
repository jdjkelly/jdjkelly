# Joshua Kelly
## YC Founder & CTO @ Flexpa

I'm building developer tooling for healthcare as a co-founder and CTO of Flexpa.

Previously, I was a solo-founder in Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch. Before that I was CTO @ Universe, acquired by Live Nation in 2015 where I managed a product team of 30.

The breadth of my skills across engineering leadership, product development, and startups is available on a fractional or advisory basis to select companies.

## üìö Stack Experience

**TypeScript** (ES6+, Node.js) is my greenfield language of choice. **Ruby** (Rails) was the first language I loved. **Elixir** and **Rust** are my weekend project languages. When necessary, I can build in **Python** and **Go** too.

On the frontend, I usually work with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**. My preferred design tool is **Figma**.

As far as protocols and query languages go, I launched a **GraphQL** API at Universe in 2017 (way before it became mainstream). I have special depth with **OAuth** - having launched Ticketmaster's production fan OAuth service.

I'm unreasonably effective at data modelling. **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite** (totally underrated) are my go-tos database-wise.

Recently, my work in healthcare has led to special knowledge of protocols like **FHIR**.

Before anyone had heard about dog-themed meme coins and bored apes, I was building on **Ethereum**, **Solidity**, and **web3.js** at ETHGlobal (Waterloo, Denver, and San Francisco).
